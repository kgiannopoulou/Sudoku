# Sudoku

Welcome to the Sudoku Solver project, a Python script that solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
